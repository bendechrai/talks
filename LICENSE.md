Where possible, all presentations are released under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Where doing so would cause a licence violation, such as there being GPL code included in the presentation package (not content) then the presentation is released under [GPLv3](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0). If this is also not possible, you may be out of luck. Get in touch and I'll try and help.

All content of the presentations, regardless of the presentation package, is released inder the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
